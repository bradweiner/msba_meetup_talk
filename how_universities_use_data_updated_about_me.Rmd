### Compile the Raw Data (Not Real Data)
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library(kableExtra,quietly = T)
library(tidyverse,quietly = T)
library(magrittr,quietly = T)
d <- read.csv("data/retention_file_raw.csv",stringsAsFactors = F)

colnames(td) <- NULL
kable(td) %>% column_spec(1,bold = TRUE,) %>% kable_styling(font_size = 14)
```
---
class: inverse,left, top
### Pre-Process the Data (Again Not Real Data)
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(fastDummies)

colnames(td) <- NULL
kable(td) %>% kable_styling(font_size = 13) %>% column_spec(1,bold = T)
```

### Explore the Data (Again Not Real Data)
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggcorrplot)

### Model the Outcome: Split Into Test and Training Sets
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(janitor)
set.seed(1876)

split <- initial_split(d, strata = retained)
retn_train <- training(split)
retn_test  <- testing(split)

kable(tabyl(retn_train$retained))

kable(tabyl(retn_test$retained))
```
---
class: inverse, left, top
### Model the Outcome: Build Basic Regression Model (This is Hacky and Poorly Specified)  
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, r,echo=T}
mod.1 <- glm(retained ~  #<<
               total_peer_group + #<<
               family_income + #<<
               first_gen_first_gen, #<<
             data = retn_train, #<<
             family = "binomial") #<<
```

### Review and Interpret the Results

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# kable(exp(mod.1$coefficients),col.names = NULL) %>% kable_styling(font_size = 15)
options(scipen = 999)
kable(tidy(mod.1,exponentiate = TRUE),digits = 5) %>% kable_styling() %>%
  row_spec(4, bold = T, color = "white", background = "red") %>%
  row_spec(3, bold = T, color = "white", background = "green") %>%
  row_spec(2, bold = T, color = "white", background = "red")
```

#### Interpretation (Fake Data)

--
#### Being classifed as first-gen_first_gen is correlated with being 0.06 times less likely to be retained in the second year when controlling for other factors in the model.

--
#### For each additional 'unit' of family_income, a student is 2.11 times more likely to be retained in the second year when controlling for other factors in the model.

### Research Question: Can we understand why first-generational students graduate at lower rates?

--
### Research Answer: Yes! We have some pretty good clues


---
class: inverse, center, middle
--

####  `r fa("check-circle", fill = "green")` Retention and graduation are key indicators of student and institutional success

--

####  `r fa("check-circle", fill = "green")` Differential rates in retention and graduation are inequitable and demand attention

--

####  `r fa("check-circle", fill = "green")` Theoretical evidence posits many theories as to why first-generational students are less likely to persist until graduation.

--

####  `r fa("check-circle", fill = "green")` Our fake data and clunky model specification indiciated two things:  

--

####  `r fa("check-circle", fill = "green")` That family income is also highly correlated and something instistutions can impact through financial aid. And...

--

####  `r fa("check-circle", fill = "green")` That students from first-generational backgrounds feel less connected, less engaged and less likely to have friends or support.

--
####  `r fa("check-circle", fill = "green")` So what can we do about it?

### We Need Your Help

--
#### The public and non-profit sectors need descriptive, predictive, and presriptive analytics to advance prosocial outcomes

--
#### These sectors aren't as far along as the private sector. This provides lots of room for innovation!

--
#### Find a business problem you care about. For me, that's helping colleges and universities, but there are endless ways to make a difference.
